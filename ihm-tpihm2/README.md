# IHM2 - Your first window

We have a quizz app to make.

Their design team produced the following mock-up:

<img src="img-US/quiz-US.JPG" alt="The quiz mockup" width="40%"/>

The expected functionalities are:
- Switch from Night to Day mode (controls at top right)
- Display a question and allow the user to enter an answer.
- Display the number of correct answers, as well as the number of incorrect answers.
- Once the user has entered an answer, **a MessageBox** tells them whether it is correct or incorrect (also gives them the correct answer in this case), then another question is displayed.
- Propose at least ten different questions.

Additional features include:
- Play a different sound when the answer is correct or incorrect.

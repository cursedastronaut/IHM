# IHM4 - Anagram
## The topic
We had to create an anagram game in WPF.

Here's a mockup of what we should have:

<img src="./img/anagramEasy-US.JPG" width="80%"/>

The expected functionalities are :
- The user can play a game of Anagram, where he or she must find the word hidden behind the jumbled word.
    - They can suggest answers.
    - They can consult/view previous suggestions.
    - There's a limited number of tries per game.
- If the word is found, the game is won (corresponding MessageBox).
- If the word is not found after all tries, the game is lost (corresponding MessageBox).
- The user can start a new game at any time, but the game in progress is considered lost.
- At the end of a game that is won or lost, the system uses a MessageBox to ask the user if he/she wishes to play again.
- The system keeps a game history.

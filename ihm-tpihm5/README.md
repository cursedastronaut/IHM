# IHM5 - Alarm Clock

In this IHM TP, we had to develop a more visual and interactive application using WPF's graphical features and a timer.

We had to create a simple clock and a way to set up alarms.

Here's a mock-up of what we should have:

<img src="./img/Alarm-US.JPG" width="30%"/>

The expected functionalities are as follows:
- Display the time
- Display a list of alarms (times, with ou without a date).
- Add and delete an alarm.
    - To delete an alarm, it must be selected in the list.
- Draw a clock and its 3 hands using WPF drawing methods to display the time in real time.
- Automatically trigger a visual signal (a color change) or sound (play a sound) when the time is that of one of the alarms in the list.
- Interrupt the alarm (visual or sound signal) to return the application to its normal state.
- Add your personal touch.
